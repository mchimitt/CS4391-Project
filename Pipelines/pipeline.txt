in order for the pipeline to work first there is a folder lets say imagenet, and that
folder has a train folder, that folder also have different folders containing
a group of images which is why we use image folder

                    img 2
                    img 3
                folder img/
                    img 1
                    img 2
                    img 3
                    img 4

Wikiart dataset
when you extract make sure to move "classes.csv
wclasses.csv" into a seperate folder "Word File"
