in order for the pipeline to work first there is a folder lets say imagenet, and that
folder has a train folder, that folder also have different folders containing
a group of images which is why we use image folder

imagenet/
        train/
                folder img/
                    img 1
                    img 2
                    img 3
                folder img/
                    img 1
                    img 2
                    img 3
                    img 4
you are going to need at least 200gb of memory for the dataset, I am currently working on the
Wikiart datatse, they also have an API to get information as well for free, im trying
to connect to it, but its being a pain
(imagenet you are going to need to download) going to mention on the next meeting

pip install -r requirements.txt
